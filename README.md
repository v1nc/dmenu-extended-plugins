# dmenu-extended-plugins
List of dmenu-extended plugins I made for saving more time every day.

## gSearch:
### Do real Google Search in your dmenu!
- Answers questions like "how old is google" directly.
- View listings like "install debian apache" directly.
- "smart copy" the things you want out of your result(like paths, commands, etc).
- View meanings of words(in progress).

#### Coming soon:
- Preview of functionality.
- Parse Books, Dates and full text descriptions.
- List all results and directly open selected.
- Open editable "priority pages" like stackoverflow directly if in results.
